- Base URL set to `/` for GitHub Pages

**TypeScript Configuration** (`tsconfig.json`):
- Strict mode enabled
- ES2020 target
- DOM and DOM.Iterable libraries
- Path mapping for `@/` alias

- Glass morphism utilities
- Custom spacing and sizing utilities

## Design System

### Color Palette (Ayu Mirage Theme)

```javascript
{
  background: '#1f2430',  // Main dark background
  surface: '#191e2a',      // Card surfaces
  panel: '#242d38',        // Elevated panels
  text: '#cbccc6',         // Primary text
  subtext: '#9da5b4',      // Secondary text
  purple: '#d4bfff',       // Accent 1
  blue: '#73d7ff',         // Accent 2
  orange: '#ffcc99',       // Accent 3
  green: '#a6cc70'         // Accent 4
}
```

### Custom Animations

- **fade-in** - 0.7s opacity transition
- **slide-up** - 0.7s vertical slide with opacity
- **scale-in** - 0.5s scale transform
- **float** - 6s infinite vertical movement
- **glow** - 2s pulsing box shadow
- **gradient** - 8s infinite background position shift

### Glass Morphism Effects

- `.glass` - Base glass effect with subtle backdrop blur
- `.glass-strong` - Enhanced glass with increased opacity and blur

### Hover Interactions

- Scale transforms (1.02-1.05x)
- Shadow elevation changes
- Color transitions with 0.3s duration
- Border color animations
- Icon transforms (rotations, translations)

## Implementation Highlights

### AnimatedElement Component
Uses the Intersection Observer API for performance-optimized scroll animations:
- Triggers only when elements are 10% visible
- Configurable animation delays for staggered effects
- Properly cleans up observers on unmount
- Supports custom animation classes

### TypingAnimation Component
Character-by-character typing simulation:
- Configurable typing speed
- Optional looping with pause between cycles
- Animated cursor that blinks
- Works with any text content

### TypingTitles Component
Rotating title display with realistic typing:
- Types forward, pauses, then deletes
- Continuous rotation through title array
- Configurable speeds for typing and deleting
- Perfect for hero sections

### NavBar Component
Sophisticated navigation with scroll detection:
- Event listeners track scroll position
- State management for mobile menu
- Color-coded navigation items from theme
- Conditional rendering based on viewport size

## Data Structure

All content is managed through TypeScript interfaces in the `src/data/` directory:

**Projects** (`projects.ts`):
```typescript
interface Project {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  blurb: string;
  tags: string[];
  area: string;
  status: 'complete' | 'in-progress' | 'planned';
  body: string;
  links: { type: string; url: string }[];
  gallery?: string[];
}
```

**Education & Experience** (`education.ts`):
```typescript
interface Education {
  institution: string;
  degree: string;
  period: string;
  gpa?: string;
}

interface Experience {
  company: string;
  role: string;
  period: string;
  achievements: string[];
  technologies: string[];
}
```

## Deployment

This portfolio is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

### CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

1. **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
2. **Install**: Dependencies installed via `npm ci`
3. **Build**: TypeScript compilation and Vite production build
4. **Deploy**: Upload `dist/` artifact and deploy to GitHub Pages

### Manual Deployment

```bash
npm run build
# The dist/ folder is ready for deployment
```

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading with Intersection Observer
- Optimized Tailwind CSS (PurgeCSS in production)
- Vite code splitting and tree shaking
- Minimal external dependencies
- CSS-based animations (hardware accelerated)

## What Went Into Building This

### Design Philosophy
The portfolio was built with a focus on clean, professional aesthetics while maintaining personality through color accents and subtle animations. The Ayu Mirage theme was chosen for its excellent readability and modern appearance.

### Development Approach
- **Component-First**: Each section is a self-contained component
- **Data-Driven**: Content is separated from presentation logic
- **Type-Safe**: TypeScript ensures data integrity
- **Performance-Conscious**: Animations use CSS transforms and Intersection Observer
- **Maintainable**: Clear file structure and naming conventions

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Vite over CRA** - Faster builds and better developer experience
2. **Tailwind over CSS-in-JS** - Utility-first approach for rapid development
3. **Glass Morphism** - Modern UI trend that works well with dark themes
4. **Single-Page Design** - Better for portfolios; all content immediately accessible
5. **GitHub Pages** - Free, reliable hosting with automated deployments

### Challenges Overcome
- Smooth scroll animations without janky performance
- Mobile menu that works across all devices
- Type-safe data structures for all content
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Responsive design that looks great on all screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Blog integration
- Project filtering by technology
- More interactive project galleries
- Contact form with backend integration
- Analytics integration

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Deployed with GitHub Pages. What started as a vibe-coded Claude Code project for fun turned out to be something exciting to build, and I learned a lot along the way.
